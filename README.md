# Scripting tools

This project contain some of my scripts for Windows and Linux ( Debian ) based os.

## Windows

### Activate Powershell script on your computer

/!\ 
To activate Powershell Script on you computer open Powershell as an administrator and enter the following command :

    `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
/!\ 

## Linux

### Debian scripts

I principally use Debian based distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint so I decided to regroup somes scripts I currently used.
